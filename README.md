## Inspiration

As UW students, we've been immersed in the buzz of startup culture. However, when trying to dive deeper, we encountered a significant hurdle: connecting with startups was challenging. This struggle to streamline the research process when seeking information about companies, particularly for networking and job opportunities, led us to create Spark. ‚ú®

Often, users need to scour various platforms for key details like company size, location, or industry‚Äîa time-consuming process. We aimed to build a tool that consolidates this information, allowing users to access relevant data faster and connect with potential contacts effortlessly. By leveraging personalized information, including a user's resume, we're semantically empowering connectivity and fostering networks.

## What it does üõ†Ô∏è

Spark is a powerful, user-friendly platform designed to revolutionize how people interact with the startup ecosystem. Here's a breakdown of its key features:

1. **Intelligent Query Processing**: Users can input queries ranging from broad requests like "Fintech companies in NY" to highly specific ones such as "GenerativeAI firms in SF with < 100 employees in their first round of funding." Our advanced natural language processing system interprets these queries accurately.

2. **Comprehensive Data Retrieval**: Leveraging vector databases, Spark identifies and presents the most relevant companies based on the user's query. It provides crucial information including:
   - Location üìç
   - Number of employees üë•
   - Funding round and amount üí∞
   - Website URL üåê
   - Industry focus üè≠
   - Key team members üë•

3. **Interactive Playground**: This feature enhances user experience and functionality:
   - Resume Analysis: Users can upload their resumes for AI-powered parsing and matching with suitable opportunities. üìÑ
   - Company Deep Dive: AI agents provide in-depth information about specific companies on demand. üîç
   - LinkedIn Integration: Users can efficiently mass-message current employees across hundreds of companies, streamlining the networking process. üåê

4. **Real-time Data Visualization**: Our platform offers dynamic charts and graphs that update in real-time as users explore different queries and datasets. üìä

5. **Personalized Recommendations**: By analyzing user interactions and preferences, Spark provides tailored suggestions for companies, roles, and networking opportunities. üéØ

Spark isn't just a search tool; it's a comprehensive ecosystem designed to empower founders, investors, job seekers, and anyone interested in the startup world to make informed decisions and meaningful connections.

## How we built it üîß

Spark leverages a powerful, modern tech stack to deliver its innovative features:
- **Groq AI**: For ultra-fast natural language processing and query interpretation üöÄ
- **Convex**: Powering our scalable backend with real-time database capabilities üîÑ
- **Cohere Rerank**: Enhancing search result relevance and quality üéØ
- **Next.js and React**: Creating a responsive, SEO-friendly frontend ‚öõÔ∏è
- **CrewAI Agents**: Implementing intelligent assistants for various user tasks ü§ñ
- **Vector Databases**: Enabling efficient semantic search capabilities üìä
- **Custom Web Scraping**: Keeping our startup data fresh and comprehensive üï∑Ô∏è
- **LinkedIn API**: Facilitating direct professional networking features üåê
- **And much more!**

This combination of cutting-edge technologies allows Spark to offer a seamless, efficient, and feature-rich platform for exploring the startup ecosystem. üí°


## Challenges we ran into üöß

- Realizing that our initial plan of getting 8 hours of sleep each day was overly optimistic‚Äîwe barely reached that total over 3 days! üò¥
- Web scraping and semantic search optimization proved to be formidable challenges. üï∏Ô∏è
- Integrating the playground flowchart with the CSV chart to add columns in real-time was complex. üìä
- Actualizing an intuitive UI from design to real life, particularly for our playground feature, was a significant hurdle. Although we were challenged to develop a working UI, we eventually created a design for our linking system. üé®

## Accomplishments that we're proud of üèÜ

- Developed a powerful, multi-faceted search algorithm capable of handling complex queries üîç
- Successfully integrated multiple cutting-edge technologies into a cohesive platform üîß
- Created an intuitive UI/UX design that simplifies startup ecosystem navigation üé®
- Implemented an efficient data scraping system to maintain an up-to-date company database üìä
- Built a scalable architecture that can grow with increasing user demands üìà

## What we learned üìö

Our journey with Spark has been an incredible learning experience:

- Mastered the intricacies of data scraping and API integrations üï∏Ô∏è
- Gained deep insights into building efficient search algorithms and vector databases üß†
- Enhanced our skills in frontend development using Next.js and React ‚öõÔ∏è
- Learned to leverage AI technologies like Groq and CrewAI for enhanced user experiences ü§ñ
- Improved our ability to create scalable, real-time applications using Convex üöÄ
- Developed a deeper understanding of the startup ecosystem and its networking dynamics üåê

This project pushed us to expand our technical skills while also broadening our understanding of the startup world, preparing us for future innovations in this space. üí°

## What's next for Spark 

Ultimately, Spark is designed to be a versatile tool that caters to a wide range of users within the startup ecosystem:

- Founders seeking potential partners or competitors üßë‚Äçüíº
- Venture capitalists researching investment opportunities üíº
- Job seekers, including students like us, looking for internships or full-time positions üéì
- Researchers and analysts studying market trends üìä
- Networking enthusiasts aiming to expand their professional connections ü§ù

Releasing this as a potential product in the future is something we will look into. No matter where you fit in the startup world, Spark is here to illuminate your path and ignite meaningful connections. Whether you're building, investing, or joining the next big thing, our platform is designed to streamline your journey through the dynamic landscape of innovation. üåü
